# Gulp-js
### A toolkit to automate &amp; enhance your workflow
### Leverage gulp and the flexibility of JavaScript to automate slow, repetitive workflows and compose them into efficient build pipelines.

 You can quick start with:  
    1- https://github.com/zulkufdemirhan/Gulp-js.git  
    2- npm install  
    3- gulp --tasks  => (you can see all your tasks that you create)  
    4- gulp taskName  
  
 Of course, we can use "gulp-js" with many packages which has other features such as "gulp-csso", "gulp-concat", "gulp-uglify" etc.
